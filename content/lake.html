<p>Washington State is home to several large lakes that are accessible within the city for a scenic walk, bike ride, or a float or swim. The lakes outside of cities can be sought out for well-earned relief from the heat on warmer days. 
Lake Crescent, Reflection Lake, Lake Sammamish, Lake Washington are all very popular tourist attractions. Boating, Paddle Boarding, Canoeing, or Jet-Skiing are all fun lake activities in between picnicing with your human and aquatic friends.
