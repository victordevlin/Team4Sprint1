<p><h2>Mountain Rainier's Directions</h2></p>

<p>

Year-round access to the park is via SR 706 to the Nisqually Entrance in the southwest corner of the park. The road from the entrance to Longmire remains open throughout winter except during extreme weather. The road from Longmire to Paradise closes nightly from November 1 through winter. It reopens the following morning dependent upon snow removal and current conditions. Even though roads will be open, some facilities may not be available.
<br>
A note on using GPS: Many visitors now use GPS (Global Positioning System) units to help them navigate while driving. However, the street address for Mount Rainier National Park (55210 238th Avenue East) leads to the Mount Rainier headquarters in Ashford, Washington, NOT to the Nisqually entrance of the park. To reach the Nisqually entrance using GPS use the address 39000 State Route 706 E, Ashford, WA 98304. This will take you on SR 706 east past the park headquarters to the Nisqually Entrance. It is recommended that visitors refer to road maps in addition to using GPS units when driving to the park.</p>
