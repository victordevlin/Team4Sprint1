  Feeling bored and wanting to relax but not keen on staying home? How about exploring the old-growth forest at Rampart Ridge? Wandering through this ancient forest is a soothing way to connect with nature, with no walls around youâ€”just fresh, open air and the sky as your ceiling. Find a spot by a 300-year-old tree to unwind with a book or a glass of wine. Hike alongside scenic streams and lakes, leading you to a picturesque campsite for a truly refreshing escape.
